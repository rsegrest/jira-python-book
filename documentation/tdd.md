Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that focuses on writing automated tests before writing the actual production code. The process involves repeatedly following three steps: writing a failing test, writing the minimal code necessary to pass the test, and then refactoring the code to improve its quality. This iterative cycle helps ensure that the software is thoroughly tested, reliable, and maintainable.

The TDD process typically follows these steps:

1. **Write a test**: The process starts by writing a test for a small piece of functionality. This test is expected to fail initially because there is no implementation code yet.

2. **Run the test**: Execute all the tests in the test suite, including the new test. Since the new test is expected to fail, it should highlight the missing functionality or any defects in the existing code.

3. **Write the minimal code**: Write the minimum amount of code required to pass the test. The goal is to make the new test pass without modifying other parts of the codebase. This code might not be perfect or optimized at this stage; the focus is on making the test pass.

4. **Run the tests again**: Execute all the tests, including the newly written test. This step verifies that the new test passes and ensures that the existing functionality remains intact.

5. **Refactor the code**: Refactor the codebase, improving its design, clarity, and efficiency while keeping all tests passing. This step involves making the code cleaner, removing duplication, improving variable names, and applying good coding practices. After refactoring, run the tests again to confirm that everything still works as expected.

6. **Repeat the cycle**: Repeat the above steps for the next piece of functionality. Start by writing a new test that fails, write the minimal code to make it pass, run the tests, refactor the code, and continue the cycle. This process is iterative and continues until all desired functionality is implemented.

TDD promotes several benefits, including:

- **Improved code quality**: By writing tests before code, developers have a clear understanding of what the code needs to do. This leads to more thoughtful and modular designs, as well as reduced bugs and easier maintenance.

- **Enhanced test coverage**: TDD encourages writing tests for both new and existing functionality. This helps ensure comprehensive test coverage, reducing the chances of regression bugs when making changes.

- **Rapid feedback loop**: TDD provides immediate feedback on the correctness of code changes. If a test fails, it alerts the developer that something is broken, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.

- **Design simplicity**: Since tests are written first, the focus is on designing minimal code that satisfies the test requirements. This approach often leads to simpler and more modular code structures.

By following the TDD process, developers can build a reliable and well-tested codebase while maintaining flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.
